  "bio": "Hi 👋, I'm P. Lakshmi Pavananjali, soon-to-be software engineer 👩‍💻 graduating from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham! While I might've considered myself an average student in exams 📝, my passion for tech has always been strong 💪. It all started back in 8th grade at LFS when I was introduced to HTML 💻, sparking a love for coding that grew with each new language: C in 9th grade, then Java and Python in 10th! 🤩 I enjoy building things (not just fixing printers 😉) and solving problems, plus I love hiking ⛰️ and the occasional beekeeping adventure 🐝 (minus the stings!).",
